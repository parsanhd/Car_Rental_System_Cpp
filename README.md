# Car_Rental_System
This project is a car rental system implemented in C++. It provides a user-friendly interface for both administrators and customers to manage and access information
about available cars. The system allows administrators to perform essential tasks such as adding new cars, deleting existing cars, and searching for cars based on 
specific criteria. Customers can view all the cars available along with their detailed qualities, helping them make informed decisions before renting a car. The 
program also generates a detailed bill for customers, displaying the cost breakdown and providing transparency in pricing.

All the data related to cars is stored in a binary file, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. The binary file format allows for faster read and write operations 
compared to other file formats. This not only improves the performance of the system but also reduces the file size. The program handles the serialization and 
deserialization of car data, enabling seamless storage and retrieval from the binary file.

To access the administrative features, the login ID is "CusAdmin" and the password is "CusPass". This authentication mechanism helps protect the system from 
unauthorized access and maintains the security of sensitive information. The program is designed to present the data in a well-organized and user-friendly manner, 
enhancing the overall user experience.
